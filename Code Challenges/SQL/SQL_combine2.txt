# (user)Problem
# we have 2 tables, but we need:
# a joined/mix of FirstName, LastName, City, State
# even if data from the later table is abscent
#
# Solution(product)
# start with Person table,
# do a 'left' join
# so it includes all items from person, even if address not there
#

# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT p.FirstName, p.LastName, a.city, a.state
FROM Person as p
LEFT JOIN Address as a
on p.PersonId = a.PersonId;
